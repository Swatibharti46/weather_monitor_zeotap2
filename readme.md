Here’s a clear and well-structured README template for my Python weather monitoring project. You can customize it as needed to better fit your project specifics.
# Weather Monitoring System

## Overview(My deployed weather_monitor_App:https://671958be4b650b7f9eb5077c--frabjous-gelato-0408c1.netlify.app/)

The **Weather Monitoring System** is a web application that allows users to check current weather conditions in various cities. This project utilizes a weather API to fetch real-time data, which is displayed in an easy-to-read format, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. Users can also set temperature alerts to receive notifications based on their specified thresholds.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches and displays the current weather conditions of any city.
  
- **User-friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface for easy navigation.
  
- **Temperature Alerts**: Users can set alerts for specific temperature thresholds to receive notifications via email.

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for use on various devices, including desktops and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language for backend logic.
  
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used for building the application.
  
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
  
- **Chart.js**: A JavaScript library for rendering dynamic charts and graphs.
  
- **Weather API**: An external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) used for fetching weather data.
